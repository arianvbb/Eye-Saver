# ☑️Eye-Saver
This program uses TKinter, PyGame and libraries already apart of Python to make a program that follows the 20-20-20 rule to ensure eye safety when sitting behind a computer.

## ❇️Features
- **PyGame**: A library that in this instance plays a sound for the 20 seconds that you're on break to give a auditory cue of when the period is over.
- **Button**: A button on each page configured to run a code that checks the input and the unit selected then print the result.
- **Dropdown**: A dropdown to be able to easily select between available units.

#### This project was made entirely in Python using the TKinter and PyGame libraries.

## 🤔The Process 
I started searching up the documentation for the TKinter library and using basic features like editing the title of the root (window) and dimensions. After began experimentation, started with text, then buttons, having the buttons do things, etc. It was all time-consuming as I had no previous experience in GUIs nor using TKinter.

After making a prototype I promptly figured out I would rather use Notebook to display tabs instead of Menu that would use a traditional menu to allow users to switch between pages, this allowed me to learn the basics of both.

Most of my time was surpisingly spent struggling with actually placing the different features inside the root, I tried both grid and pack, encountered problems and went back and solved it.

## 📚My takeaways 

I learnt a ton of TKinter and hope to be able to make something new in TKinter soon, my main takeaways came from: Label, Notebook, Menu, Button, Title, Geometry, Grid and Pack.

I figured out the basics of TKinter, how to make simple things run and how to make it look okay, using fonts, sizes, etc.

This is also the first time I genuinly realised the importance of writing clean, structured and strictly necessary code; which is something I'll focus on moving forward.

## 🚀Running the project 

1. Copy the program to your computer.
2. Using an editor and Python installed you can simply run the program and it should run fine.
