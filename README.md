# ☑️Eye-Saver
This program uses TKinter, PyGame and libraries already apart of Python to make a program that follows the 20-20-20 rule to ensure eye safety when sitting behind a computer.

## ❇️Features
- **PyGame**: A library that in this instance plays a sound for the 20 seconds that you're on break to give a auditory cue of when the period is over.
- **Basic functionality**: I have labels, buttons with good spacing and have for the first time taken the liberty to change colors and make grid spacing work.
- **Timer**: A timer inside the code that reveals the UI every 20 minutes for 20 seconds then dissapears.

#### This project was made entirely in Python using the TKinter and PyGame libraries.

## 🤔The Process 
I started by researching whether I should use frames for the 2 different pages but landed on rather just having everything on one and having it simple. Might not be super expandable but it works.

As I already knew how to make fonts, text, buttons, and their functionality the main problem in this project was getting the grid layout to work, this is where I spent a vast majority of my time.

I got stuck on a few core concepts which I figured out thanks to the help from some people I found in online communities.

## 📚My takeaways 

This time in TKinter I primarely learnt to change colors and actually use the grid to lay it out like one wants to.

I also discovered that after a few more projects in TKinter I will switch to PyQt6, TKinter is to get the hang of things.

This project also reinforced a lot of core Python concepts like -= or +=, as well as specifying global integers locally, defining functions, etc.

## 🚀Running the project 

1. Copy the program to your computer.
2. Using an editor with Python and the other libraries installed you can simply run the program and it should run fine.
